# Dijkstra's algorithm
I have implemented Dijkstra's algorithm which for what I understand is a greedy algorithm which at every step picks the node which has the minimum cost. We maintain a priority queue which gives the node which has the smallest distance/cost from the current node. We put the source node in the queue first and then run a loop on every child node of the current node and add all of them to the priority queue and automatically, closest node will be at the top.I have defined state of every node which also stores it's parent node, therefore when we hit our target we can backtrack and find the path that we took.


## How to play?

- First choose your starting point by clicking on the start button and then click on the grid that you want to select
- After then click the goal button and choose the goal node
- Click on the run button to run the algorithm
